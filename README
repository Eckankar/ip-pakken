To create an installer from this:

    * Download emacs binaries and place in emacs-24.3
        Link: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/
    * Download Moscow ML binaries and place in mosml
        Link: http://www.itu.dk/~sestoft/mosml.html
    * Download setenv.exe and place in root folder
        Link: http://www.codeguru.com/cpp/w-p/win32/tutorials/article.php/c10849
        Note: setenv.exe is 16-bit, so it will need to be compiled from source as 32-bit.
    * Download and install Inno Setup (non-unicode version)
        Link: http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
    * Open the .iss file and select Build > Compile from the menu.

Tested with:
    emacs 24.3, full binary distribution
    Moscow ML 2.10
    SetEnv 1.04
    InnoSetup 5.5.3 non-unicode

Gotchas:
    * If debugging the installer, please do note that it does not write a .emacs if it already exists, nor does the uninstaller remove it.
