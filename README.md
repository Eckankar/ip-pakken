# IP-Pakken

## To create an installer

* Download emacs binaries and place in emacs-24.3
    Link: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/
* Download Moscow ML binaries and place in mosml
    Link: http://www.mosml.org
* Download and install Inno Setup (non-unicode version)
    Link: http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
* Open the .iss file and select Build > Compile from the menu.

## Tested with

* emacs 24.3, full binary distribution

## Gotchas

* If debugging the installer, please do note that it does not write a .emacs if it already exists, nor does the uninstaller remove it.
